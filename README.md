# Simple C# INI file parser
A simple .INI parser written in C#, able to read from memory, file or any StreamReader.
<br>
Made primarily for the purpose of exercise and getting to know C# better.

## Example
```sh
# To build the example execute:
make
# or
make build

# To run the example with default file paths just execute:
make run
# (you may need to copy example .ini to the same folder as
# executable or specify full path to it)

# Specify your own .ini input and output files by running the program with:
./parizer [<input_filename>] [<output_filename>]

# ... or go look into the Makefile and copy, adjust and run the commands manually.
```
